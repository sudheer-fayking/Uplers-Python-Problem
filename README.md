## Task description
Alice and Bob work in a beautiful orchard. There are N apple trees in the orchard. The apple trees are arranged in a row and they are numbered from
1 to N.

Alice is planning to collect all the apples from K consecutive trees and Bob is planning to collect all the apples from L consecutive trees. They want
to choose two disjoint segments (one consisting of K trees for Alice and the other consisting of L trees for Bob) so as not to disturb each other.
What is the maximum number of apples that they can collect?

Write a function:

      def solution(A, K, L)
      
that, given an array A consisting of N integers denoting the number of apples on each apple tree in the row, and integers K and L denoting,
respectively, the number of trees that Alice and Bob can choose when collecting, returns the maximum number of apples that can be collected by
them, or −1 if there are no such intervals.

For example, given A = [6, 1, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7, 4], K = 3, L = 2, your function should return 24, because Alice can choose trees 3 to 5 and collect 4 + 6 + 3 =
13 apples, and Bob can choose trees 7 to 8 and collect 7 + 4 = 11 apples. Thus, they will collect 13 + 11 = 24 apples in total, and that is the maximum
number that can be achieved.

Given A = [10, 19, 15], K = 2, L = 2, your function should return −1, because it is not possible for Alice and Bob to choose two disjoint intervals.

Assume that:

* N is an integer within the range [2..100];
* K and L are integers within the range [1..N - 1];
* each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..500].

In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
